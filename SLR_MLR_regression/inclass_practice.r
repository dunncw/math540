# Suppose the response variable is y and regressor is x. A
# polynomial regression model of degree q is given by:
# yi = β0 + β1x + β2x2 + · · · + βq xq + εi

# Polynomials are extremely useful as they allow for more flexible
# models.
# Consider the autompg data set. The objective is to forecast mpg
# using hp. Create a 60(train):30(validation):10(test) partition of the autompg data set.

# Fit polynomial regression models of 2 and higher degree.

# Compare the MSE for each model in validation data.

# What degree seems to be an optimal fit?

# Calculate the MSE for the optimal model on the test data set.
